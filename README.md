# Sober-HiCs
Small wrapper to work with Cooler and hicExplorer data and conduct some differential analysis.
Currently it has three files: 'Control-panel' which is a wrapper to run hicExplorer commands more easily and generate and store some plot's metadata; 'Matrix-routines' which includes functions for differential and time-series analysis on a group of Cooler matrices; and 'InBed-routines' which combines bedtools and deeptools to get biological data associated with extracted TADs.
