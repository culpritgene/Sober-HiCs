# Sober-HiCs
Small wrapper to work with Cooler and hicExplorer data and conduct some differential analysis. <br />
Currently it contains three files: <b>Control-panel</b> which is a wrapper to run hicExplorer commands more easily and generate and store some plot's metadata. <br /> <b>Matrix-routines</b> which includes functions for differential and time-series analysis on a group of Cooler matrices. <br /> And  <b>InBed-routines</b> which combines bedtools and deeptools to get biological data associated with extracted TADs.
